Using Python in the web
=======================

Examples of implementing basic blocks for
web applications, for learning both Python
and web concepts.

The examples were originally published in
the wiki at LinuxCabal:

https://wiki.cabal.mx/wiki/CÃ³mo_usar_Python_en_la_web

Here in github they are easier to download,
test and improve than in the wiki.
